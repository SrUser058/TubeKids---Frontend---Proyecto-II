### How install?

To start, I recommend you use Visual Code to use some extension like:

* Thunder Client
* Live Server 

That helps you to run the client website and checks the request with the APIs.

Also you gonna need the backend of the REST API to do the request, that is save in the repository [https://github.com/SrUser058/TubeKids---Backend---Proyecto-II](https://github.com/SrUser058/TubeKids---Backend---Proyecto-II) and the Graphql API in this repository []()

Read the README.md file into both repositories to know how start to do request with the client.

**REMEMBER,** to start using the client, right click on the login.html file and click "Open with Live Server", on case yu don't open first this file the client will crash or will not work well.
